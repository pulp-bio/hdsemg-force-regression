# Event-based Estimation of Hand Forces from High-Density Surface EMG on a Parallel Ultra-Low-Power Microcontroller



## Introduction
This repository contains the code to reproduce our paper M. Zanghieri _et al._, “Event-based Estimation of Hand Forces from High-Density Surface EMG on a Parallel Ultra-Low-Power Microcontroller” [[1]](#1).
It is an extension of our previous work M. Zanghieri _et al._, “Event-based low-power and low-latency regression method for hand kinematics from surface EMG” [[2]](#2).



## Usage
1. Run ``experiment_regressions.ipynb`` (or equivalently ``experiment_regressions.py``). 
2. Run ``read_results.ipynb`` to get the results statistics.
